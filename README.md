## Description
Gnomish tackles the challenge of ensuring privacy-preserving public goods funding on Base, a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. Our project aims to achieve this by developing mechanisms that enable:

- Secure and transparent contributions to public goods initiatives.
- Protection of donor identities, throughout the voting/project selection process.

By leveraging the capabilities of Base, and Secret Network, Gnomish strives to empower individuals to support public goods while safeguarding their privacy.
